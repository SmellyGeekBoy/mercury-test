Mercury Test
============

So I had this crazy idea, to use the [Mercury Web Parser](https://mercury.postlight.com/web-parser/) as a kind of proxy for a particular device, to make nicely formatted pages for said device. I cobbled this together in PHP in an hour as a proof-of-concept. I actually changed my mind halfway through and decided I need to rewrite it in JavaScript, so I guess that's the first item on the TODO list...

Trust me, I am going somewhere with it, but I'm not quite ready to reveal my masterplan just yet! ;)

Note that if you want to play with this, you'll need to get an API key from the above URL and put it in a file called api.key. Also you'll need a way to serve up PHP (Apache, NGINX/PHP-FPM, XAMPP, y'know)
